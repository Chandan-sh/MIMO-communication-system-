# MIMO Communication System

## Project Overview

This project involves designing and simulating a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication system to analyze its performance in terms of data rate, reliability, and spectral efficiency. The system uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance.

### Applications
- 5G
- Wi-Fi (802.11n/ac)
- LTE
- Other wireless communication systems

### Key Concepts
- Spatial multiplexing
- Diversity
- Beamforming
- Channel modeling

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the transmitter, channel, receiver, and simulation.
- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation and reports for the project.
- `results/`: Contains the results of the simulation, including plots and performance analysis.
- `tools/`: Contains scripts and files for different tools and libraries used in the project (MATLAB, Python, Simulink).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

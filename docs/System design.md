# System Design

## Transmitter

### Input Data

- Generate a binary or modulated signal (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM).

### MIMO Encoding

- **Spatial Multiplexing**: Split the data stream into multiple parallel streams for each antenna.
- **Diversity Techniques**: Use Alamouti coding or other space-time block codes (STBC) for improved reliability.

### Modulation

- Apply digital modulation schemes (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM) to the data streams.

## Channel Model

### MIMO Channel

- Simulate a wireless channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas.

### Rayleigh Fading

- Model multipath fading for realistic wireless conditions.

### Path Loss and Shadowing

- Include large-scale fading effects.

### Channel Matrix (H)

- Represent the channel as a matrix where each element describes the gain between a transmit-receive antenna pair.

## Receiver

### Signal Detection

- **Zero Forcing (ZF)**: Simple linear detection method.
- **Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)**: Improved detection with noise consideration.
- **Maximum Likelihood (ML)**: Optimal but computationally intensive.

### Demodulation

- Convert the received signal back to binary data.

### MIMO Decoding

- Recombine the parallel streams into a single data stream.

# Performance Analysis

## Metrics

- **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: The number of bit errors divided by the total number of transmitted bits.
- **Symbol Error Rate (SER)**: The number of symbol errors divided by the total number of transmitted symbols.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The ratio of signal power to the noise power.

## Plots

- **BER vs. SNR Plot**: Show how the Bit Error Rate changes with Signal-to-Noise Ratio for different MIMO configurations.
- **Spectral Efficiency**: Compare the data rates achieved with MIMO vs. SISO (Single Input Single Output).
- **Diversity Gain**: Demonstrate improved reliability using diversity techniques.

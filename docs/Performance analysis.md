# Performance Analysis

## Metrics

- **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: 
  The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a critical measure in digital communication systems. It represents the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transmitted bits over a communication channel. A bit error occurs when a bit (0 or 1) is received incorrectly. BER is used to gauge the performance of a communication system, and lower BER values indicate better performance.

- **Symbol Error Rate (SER)**: 
  The Symbol Error Rate (SER) is similar to BER but focuses on symbols instead of individual bits. A symbol may represent multiple bits (e.g., in higher-order modulation schemes). SER is calculated by dividing the number of symbol errors by the total number of transmitted symbols. Like BER, a lower SER indicates a more reliable communication system.

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: 
  The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a measure of the signal strength relative to the background noise. It is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power. Higher SNR values indicate a clearer and more distinguishable signal, which typically results in better communication performance.

## Plots

- **BER vs. SNR Plot**: 
  This plot illustrates how the Bit Error Rate (BER) changes with varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for different MIMO configurations. By plotting BER against SNR, we can visualize the impact of noise on the system's performance. Different MIMO configurations (such as varying the number of antennas) can be compared to understand their effectiveness in improving BER.

- **Spectral Efficiency**: 
  Spectral efficiency measures the data rate that can be achieved over a given bandwidth in a communication system. By comparing the spectral efficiency of MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems with SISO (Single Input Single Output) systems, we can demonstrate the advantages of MIMO in terms of higher data rates and better utilization of the available spectrum.

- **Diversity Gain**: 
  Diversity gain refers to the improvement in signal reliability and performance achieved by using multiple communication paths. In MIMO systems, diversity techniques such as spatial diversity (using multiple antennas) can significantly enhance the system's robustness against fading and other impairments. By demonstrating diversity gain, we showcase the benefits of using MIMO technology for more reliable communication.

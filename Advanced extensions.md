# Advanced Extensions

## Beamforming

Implement beamforming techniques to focus signals in specific directions.

## Massive MIMO

Simulate a system with a large number of antennas (e.g., 64x64).

## Channel Estimation

Add channel estimation algorithms to improve detection accuracy.

## Real-Time Implementation

Use SDR hardware (e.g., USRP, HackRF) to implement a real-time MIMO system.
